                This is a Halal investment structured under the Mudarabah model,
                where the Investor contributes capital and the Company manages
                the business. Profits are shared according to a pre-agreed
                ratio, and the investment carries no element of interest (Riba),
                ensuring strict adherence to Islamic financial principles.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted small">
                It is a lasting investment with high social and financial profit
                sharing. You're not just funding a projectâ€”you're making a Halal
                investment in a future where ethical finance and sustainable
                agriculture grow hand in hand.
